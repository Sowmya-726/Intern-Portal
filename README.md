# Intern-Portal

The **Intern Portal** is a basic full-stack web application designed for interns to log in, view their dashboard, check their leaderboard position, and track referrals or rewards. It simulates a functional intern management system using a custom backend API and a static frontend.

How to Run the Project
### Backend

1. Open terminal and go to the backend folder:
   cd backend

2. Install dependencies and start the server:
   npm install  
   node server.js

✅ The backend runs on http://localhost:3000

### Frontend

1. Open the frontend folder.

2. Open the following HTML files in your browser:
   - `index.html` → Login & Dashboard
   - `leaderboard.html` → Leaderboard
   - `rewards.html` → Referral and Rewards

Make sure the backend server is running before opening these pages, as they fetch user data via API calls.
